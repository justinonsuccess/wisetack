This is a complete frontend user experience for a SaaS/ISV API integration with Wisetack. 

If you are integrating with Wisetack and you'd like a solid UX for boarding Wisetack merchants and helping them manage their accounts, this will save you a lot of time getting setup. 

This repo includes:

1) Merchant Pre-Enablement Screen - Aka. The Sales Thread. 
This includes strong copy, clear call to actions, and proper pre-qualification - to make sure you set their expectations accurately. 

2) Application In-Review / Pending Screen
This screen properly informs merchants and maintains their expectaitons while their application is being reviewed. 

3) Application Rejected Screen
This screen properly notifies merchants they do not meet the qualifications to qualify to offer Wisetack consumer financing on their account. 

4) Manage Wisetack Account
This screen gives your approved merchants an easy to navigate, single screen dashboard to manage their Consumer Financing Preferences. They can select ehe financing offers they'd like to offer.

This is currently a frontend UX only, not a functional backend API integration.
